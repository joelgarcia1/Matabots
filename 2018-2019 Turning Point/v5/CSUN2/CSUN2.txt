# CSUN 2

CSUN2 was the CSUN Matabots' second team. 

This team had members that were either new or had some experience with VEX Robotics.

Our team, with some assistance from our Veterans, was able to qualify for 
World's at the 2019 Southwest VEX U Regional Qualifying Tournament in Arizona.

Above (or below) is the code that was created by our programmers: Joshua Poblete & Sangat "Sunny" Shah), 
and used at the 2019 VEX U World's Competition in Kentucky.

Sangat worked mainly on the CSUN2 Big Bot (Ash)
Joshua worked mainly on the CSUN2 Small Bot (Pikachu)
